  markdown: "<p>For Hackdays, I decided that I’d work on a month for a designer calendar.
    I decided to focus on October, as it’s the peak of when all the fall colours are
    changing and the leaves are falling. The calendar didn’t end up panning out, but
    I was happy with how the lettering turned out. I started off getting an idea of
    styles, and how the characters could fit together. After doing a few rough sketches,
    I made a couple tweaks in pen. These early sketches work to inform the higher
    fidelity lettering. After nailing down the style, I moved on to a larger size.</p>"
